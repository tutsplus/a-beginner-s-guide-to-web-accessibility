### Tuts+ Course: A Beginner’s Guide to Web Accessibility
#### Instructor: John Hartley

Web accessibility is quickly becoming a topic that is unavoidable. Access to the web is becoming a basic human right, but many sites are inaccessible to people with a wide range of disabilities. This course will identify the different disabilities that must be accounted for, the benefits to all users when your site is more accessible and how to be proactive when it comes to WCAG conformance. 

Whether you’re a designer, developer, project manager or CEO, this course will help you realize accessibility is worth the time it takes to make improvements and if added into the workflow of a project is not much extra effort. At the end of the day, if you make even one site improvement, the Internet will be a better place.
